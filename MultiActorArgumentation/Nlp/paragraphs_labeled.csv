0#b'Penal liability shall be incurred only by a person who commits an act prohibited under penalty, by a law in force at the time of its commission.'
0#b'A prohibited act whose social consequences is insignificant shall not constitute an offence.'
0#b'The perpetrator of an prohibited act does not commit an offence if guilt cannot be attributed to him at the time of the commission of the act.'

0#b'Penalties and other measures provided for in this Code shall be applied with a view to humanitarian principles, particularly with the respect for human dignity.  2'
0#b'If at the time of adjudication the law in force is other than that in force at the time of the commission of the offence, the new law shall be applied. However, the former law should be applied if it is more lenient to the perpetrator.'
0#b'If, according to the new law, the act to which the sentence pertained is subject to a penalty whose upper limit is lower than the penalty imposed, this penalty shall be lowered to the upper limit of the statutory penalty provided for such an act in the new law.'
0#b'If, according to the new law, the act to which the sentence pertained, is no longer subject to penalty of imprisonment, such an enforceable penalty is commuted to a fine or to a restriction of liberty, assuming that one month deprivation of liberty is equivalent to 60 times the daily fine or two months restriction of liberty.'
0#b'If according to the new law the act to which the sentence pertained is no longer prohibited under penalty, the sentence shall be expunged by virtue of the law.'

0#b'A prohibited act shall be deemed to have been committed at the time when the perpetrator has acted or omitted to take an action which he was under obligation to perform.'
0#b'A prohibited act shall be deemed to have been committed at the place where the perpetrator has acted or has omitted an action which he was under obligation to perform, or where the criminal consequence has ensued or has been intended by the perpetrator to ensue.'
0#b'The offence is either a crime or a misdemeanour.  3'
0#b'The crime is a prohibited act subject to penalty of imprisonment of not less than 3 years or to a more severe penalty.'
0#b'A misdemeanour is a prohibited act subject to penalty of a fine higher than 30 times the daily fine, penalty of restriction of liberty or penalty of deprivation of liberty not exceeding one month.'
0#b'A crime may be committed only with intent; the misdemeanour may also be committed without intent, if the law so stipulates.'
0#b'A prohibited act is committed with intent when the perpetrator has the will to commit it, that is when he is willing to commit or foreseeing the possibility of perpetrating it, he accepts it.'
0#b'A prohibited act is committed without intent when the perpetrator not having the intent to commit it, nevertheless does so because he is not careful in the manner required under the circumstances, although he should or could have foreseen the possibility of committing the prohibited act.'
0#b'The perpetrator shall be liable to a more severe liability which the law makes contingent on a certain consequence of a prohibited act, if he has and could have foreseen such a consequence.'

0#b'If the law provides for an option of the type of penalty, the court shall impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty without suspending execution thereof, only when no other penalty or penal measure would not serve the purpose thereof.'
0#b'No fine shall be imposed  when the income of the perpetrator, his situation or potential to earn provide reasonable grounds for the supposition that the perpetrator would not honour the fine and that  19  enforcing the same by execution would not be possible.'
0#b'If the offence is subject to a penalty of a deprivation of liberty not exceeding 5 years, the court, instead of imposing this penalty may impose a fine or a penalty of restriction of liberty, particularly when it imposes a penal measure at the same time.'
0#b'The provision of \xc2\xa7 3 does not apply to the perpetrator of an intentional  misdemeanour who has previously been sentenced to a deprivation of liberty for a period of not less than 6 months without conditional suspension of its execution.'
0#b'If the offence is subject only to a penalty of a deprivation of liberty not exceeding 3 years or, alternatively, to the penalties specified in Article 32, sections 1 through 3, and the social consequences of the act are not great, the court may renounce the imposition of the penalty if it decides to impose a penal measure at the same time, and the purpose of such a penalty is thus served by the measure.'

0#b'If the act in question is subject, alternatively, to the penalties specified in Article 32 sections 1 through 3, the extraordinary mitigation of a penalty shall consist in renouncing the imposition of the penalty, and the imposition of a penal measure as specified in Article 39 sections 2 through 8; the provision of Article 61 \xc2\xa7 2 shall not be applied.'
0#b'The court may renounce the imposition of a penalty in the cases specified by law or in the case provided for in Article 60 \xc2\xa7 3, particularly if the role of the perpetrator in the commission of the act was of secondary importance, and the information transmitted has helped to prevent the commission of another offence.'
0#b'Renouncing from the imposition of penalty, the court may refrain from adjudging a penal measure, even if adjudging it were mandatory.'
0#b'Upon deciding to impose a penalty of deprivation of liberty, the court may determine the kind and type of penal institution where the sentenced person is to serve the term and to stipulate the therapeutic methods for serving the term of deprivation of liberty.'
0#b'The period of an actual deprivation of liberty in a given case, rounded to a full number of days, shall be credited to the penalty of deprivation of liberty, with one day of actual deprivation of liberty equalling one day of the penalty of deprivation of liberty, or two days of the penalty of restriction of liberty, or two daily rates of a fine.'
0#b'The actual period of preventive measures of the corresponding kinds, as specified in Article 276 of the Code of criminal procedure, shall be credited against the imposed measures specified in Article  22  39 sections 2 and 3 of this Code.   \n CHAPTER VIII   Relapse into crime'
0#b'If a perpetrator sentenced to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for an offence committed with intent, during the 5 year period after having served at least 6 months of the penalty, commits an intentional offence similar to the offence for which he had been sentenced, the court may impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty, prescribed for the offence committed,  within the statutory \nlimits, up to the highest statutory penalty further increased by a half.'

Measures connected with the placing the   perpetrator under probation'
0#b'The court may conditionally discontinue the criminal proceedings if the guilt and social consequences of the act are not significant, the circumstances of its commission do not raise doubts, and the attitude of the perpetrator not previously penalised for an intentional offence, his personal characteristics and his way of life to date provide reasonable grounds for the assumption that even in the \nevent of the discontinuance of the proceedings, he will observe the legal order and particularly that he will not commit an offence.'

0#b'If the most severe penalty imposed for one of the concurrent offences is the penalty of 25 years of deprivation of liberty or deprivation of liberty for life, this penalty is imposed as the aggregate penalty; in the case of the aggregation of two or more penalties of 25 years of deprivation of liberty, the court may impose the penalty of deprivation of liberty for life as the aggregate penalty.'

0#b'That the separate penalties imposed for the offences in a series or concurrent offences  33  have already been satisfied, in whole or part, is no impediment to the imposition of  an aggregate penalty, the provision of Article 72 \xc2\xa7 .2 shall be applied accordingly.   \n Chapter X.
